# broadcast_receiver

This is an app I used to learn to handle broadcast receivers in android. 
As it is targeted to API version 31, higher than 26, the broadcast receiver is registered in the mainActivity. 
If it was targeted to API version 26 or lower, the registration should be done in the manifest.
I put the brodcast registration code in the manifest file as a comment
